     <h2>About Me</h2>
     
      <p>The company I worked for went under after the pandemic hit. For years I dreamt of buying and living on a sailboat. I saved money and took sailing courses on my time off and waited for the right opportunity to pursue this dream. With an open schedule beginning in March 2020, I went for it. I bought a sailboat in Long Beach, California, and moved onto it. After fixing it up and acquainting myself I sailed north to Ventura where I settled down for a while.</p>

      <p>To pay the bills and feed myself I played music for cash at a local bar in the harbor on the weekends. After a few months, the marina informed me that I wasn't allowed to live full time in the harbor, so I sailed twenty miles out to Santa Cruz Island for a few days a week to comply with the marina's rules. I lived ‚Äúon the hook‚Äù at that island. During that time I sought to upgrade my navigation equipment, but big brand marine electronics are expensive. I then came across some crafty sailors on the internet who used a Raspberry Pi as a cost-effective way to program their own navigation systems. So I bought one and gave it a go. This introduced me to computer programming for the first time. I experienced a familiar satisfaction in building and creating, so I looked further into this new world of computer programming, seeking to learn more. Then winter approached and brought hairy winds and seas, forcing me to keep my boat at port. I then had to hit the road to comply with the marina‚Äôs rules, living out of my car and camping, which wasn't a great learning environment, postponing my programming education. 
      </p>

      <p>Finally, I grew tired of constantly moving around and wanted to establish a more secure career and stable lifestyle while working in an industry that I began to feel passionate about. So, I sold my boat to pay for a coding bootcamp, rode my motorcycle back to Texas, and moved into my parents house to afford this change and focus intently on this new path. I am eager to continue building a career in web development.</p>
