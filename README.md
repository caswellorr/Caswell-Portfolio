# 📐 Caswell's Portfolio

This is a start to my first online portfolio. It's a work in progress, but I dig it so far...

## 📝 Notes

As of Nov 9, the page is not very reponsive to mobile devices, especially iPhone X. 

I struggled to properly configure the containers in the MAIN section, but after playing around for a while, I figured it out by setting the flex-direction to column to stack the text h2 then floating the image next top the text. 

I copy and pasted the Contact Form from W3 schools then edited it a bit. The submit buttom doesnt send the information anywhere. The placeholder text might also be a bit small..


## 🏆 Goals

Fill About Me container with a short story or some cool looking list of skills, etc... or both..

Can I build a database that stores submissions (emails, names, and messages?

I'd like to add more tabs in the navbar that reflect my other interets and hobbies (Writing and Music) that lead to another page that houses those things. How do you do that? Maybe my drawings, too...
OR
Do you keep those things separate from your "programmer portfolio" ?
