# 📐 Caswell's Portfolio

This is a start to my first online portfolio. It's a work in progress, but I dig it so far...

## 📝 Notes

This portfolio features a navigation bar that links the text to the corresponding sections on the page.

The About Me section features a brief description of myself written in Latin for now, and an avatar showing a doodle of my face that I drew a while back.

Below the About Me section is a Projects section, also written in Latin, that will include a list of projects. I am still working on them.

Lastly, the Contact Me presents a form that the user can fill out their name and email then write me a brief message regardiung the subject of their outreach before submitting it (to somewhere).

Included are links to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages that can be accessed by clicking on the logos.
